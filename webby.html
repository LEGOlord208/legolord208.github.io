<h1>jWebby - A better DOM API</h1>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/LEGOlord208/legolord208.github.io/releases/download/any/jWebby.jar">Download</a></h1>

<p><i>Crawling a website is our territory! And why not use JTidy to clean things up on the fly?</i></p>

<p>
	This is a better Java DOM API than the built in one.
	If a website is broken, why not make sure it works anyways?
	By default, we fix the sites with <a href="http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/">JTidy</a>.
	If this breaks something or if you don't want to install the JTidy library, you can disable it via <code>Webby.setTidy(false);</code>
