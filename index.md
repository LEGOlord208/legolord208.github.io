Hello World. Nice to meet you. I'm an idiot.  
My life sucks, and so does my choices throughout my life.  
If you're really interested to know, then go over to [History](history.html).

Sorry for bothering you. You're probably looking for my crappy [software](software.html).

I hate writing index pages and describing myself. What should I say on them?  
I have Asperger's syndrome. For me it gets rid of those useless social skills I never use and
throw them in the ~~trash~~ Recycling Bin (don't wanna be one to let down the environment).  
My subconscious is also afraid you're better than me. Fuck my subconsciousness. How does it matter who "is better"?  
I hate myself.

If you feel like I just threw a bunch of useless information at you at once, you're welcome.
I mean, isn't it a good thing? Everyone acts like school is a good thing, and that's what they do... So...  
If not, ask me anything you think I missed. [Contact Me](contact.html).
