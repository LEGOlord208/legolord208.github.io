			<h1>Hi!</h1>
I'm LEGOlord208, you know, the one this website is about. That's me. Hello!<br />
I like programming and obviously computers.<br />
I create software, games, website and more.<br />
And I play Minecraft. I like command blocks and modelling in Cubik.<br />
I also created a few mods which all sucked.

<p>I have the diagnosis "Asperger's", so prepare for me to be quite awkward if we talk.<br />
My real name is Samuel and I have an ugly voice.</p>

<p>If you want to know why my name is "LEGOlord208", check "History"<br />
in the handy tab above.</p>

<p>If you want to know why this website is "krake.one" and not "legolord208.com" or something,<br />
just press the same button >:D</p>

<p>If you are here for some software, press the "Software" tab... Obviously...<br />
And if you are a fellow coder and are looking for some neat libraries, press "Libraries" :3</p>

<p><b>If you are a coder, I might seem a bit weirder to you if we talk, here is why:</b><br />
I like you. I really do. But for some reason my mind starts screaming "DANGER, DANGER",<br />
and make me all stressed because you are a "competitor", even though I don't even like competitions.<br />
This is something I just have to ignore, and please don't feel hurt about it.<br />
Once we've been friends for a short time and I learn how often you code, what you can do, et.c<br />
I'll definately get more friendly. Hopefully I'm able to hide it so well during my get-to-know period,<br />
so you don't notice it. Because I appreciate friends, I really do.</p>
