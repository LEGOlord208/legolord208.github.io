			<p><b>Many years ago...</b></p>

<p>I was interested in theater and joined some Theater club thingy outside school.<br />
Not sure how to describe it without it sounding stupid</p>

<p>I was interested in lego and I started creating brickfilms, lego movies or whatever<br />
they were actually called, all day long</p>

<p>I got a YouTube channel. I had no idea of a name, so I asked mom.<br />
She had the idea "Lego Lord". Of course not available, so I added some numbers<br />
<b>FACEPALM</b><br />
Also, the lego logo is written with capital letters, so it gotta be <i>LEGOlord208</i>, right...<br />
<b>FACEPALM</b>
</p>

<p>A friend told me to get Minecraft.<br />
"No" I believe I said.<br />
"If I'd get it, I'd get the DEMO version" (Is there even one btw :3)</p>

<p>A long time since then, the club thingy showed the Theater we worked on<br />
for our parents and whomever wanted to come.<br />
In the car home, dad said he was going to give the family Minecraft (back in good old 1.5).</p>

<p>Together we chose a bad username.<br />
I played it for some time, and I was addicted immediately</p>

<p>I told all my friends about it the first thing I did when I<br />
came to school the next day. I also asked "How do I open doors",
"Is it possible to build a roller coaster",<br />
"Can you build an elevator".</p>

<p>I started looking at Minecraft videos on YouTube on a non-touchscreen device<br />
later (because I had no touchscreen). I couldn't even like, comment or subscribe on<br />
that version. But I started watching, first Swedish, then English.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dragnoz">dragnoz</a>, and I looked<br />
through all kinds of videos, sometimes even twice or three times.</p>

<p>I got a tablet and watched hundreds of videos suddenly. It still happens I find<br />
old channels I un-subcribed from. I watched TONS. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CNBMinecraft">
	CNB</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/adamgorgeous">Adam Clarke</a>, et.c, et.c<br />
But with all those tons of videos, there was always one video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dragnoz">dragnoz</a>
finishing the day, and making it perfect.<br />He is actually the main reason I know English at all.</p>

<p>Many years later, I stumbled across MCEdit and Filters. I immediately wanted to make one.<br />
<i>(Which I was never able to do before losing interest, by the way)</i><br />
Some guy in the comment section told me to learn python, so I did.<br />
Even though that comment was wrong (because you obviously also need to know the MCEdit API),<br />
That's when I realised the beauty of programming.</p>

<p>I dropped lego somewhere around here. Also I dropped Theater, too. Somewhere around here<br />
I also got my own Minecraft username</p>

<p>A long time later I started hating Scratch (I never actually tried it, I just watched videos et.c)<br />
and I wanted to know more and more languages.<br />
I got a book about HTML, people told me to learn C++, but for myself, I thought. One day I'll learn<br />
Java and create amazing software</p>

<p>When learing C++ I started working on a new programming language.<br />
<i>(You'll see why this is bad later on)</i>.<br />
I called it <b><i>Krake</i></b>. That was the name of my cuddly toy dragon,<br />
which my mother once again named :P</p>

<p>I decided to go my own route and learn Java, and Jesus I'm in love<br />
(not actually though, love is disgusting) :P<br />
The main reason was to create Bukkit plugins, but later also Forge mods.<br />
<i>By the way, I coded my own mod before even knowing how to install one ;)</i><br />
With ideas from <a href="https://twitter.com/Timelord30021">@Timelord30021</a>, I started on a HUGE mod.<br />
But after some time of bad and inefficient coding (believe me, I sucked),<br />
I started watching a few videos on Java Swing. AND JESUS THIS TIME I'M IN LOVE. FOR REAL.<br />
(Still not actually, though. It's still disgusting :P)<br /></p>

<p>I abandoned the mod and I started working on Java Swing.<br />
Calculators, Text processing software, and much more. All of them badly coded.<br />
(By the way, you can still access them at <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/legolord208/">my Google Sites</a>)<br />
But I learned and learned. Finally, I decided I should make my own programming language.<br />
<b>FACEPALM</b><br />
We do not need another language, <i>please LEGOlord</i>.<br />
Whatever, I made one. Messy code. Named <b><i>Krake</i></b></p>

<p>I made a derpy website on "krake.comxa.com" (000webhost. <b><i>REGRETS</i></b>).<br />
Me and a friend who changes name all the time, so I can't write it here haha,<br />
started working on Krake4You. To be honest, I was the one doing the work.<br />
I called it "3rd party" by the way, even though I was the one who created Krake itself -_-<br />
<b>FACEPALM</b></p>

<p>Krake4You was supposed to sell Krake scripts, even though we never did that :|<br />
We did have a working, but messy chat and login, though</p>

<p>Somewhere here I got Krake and Krake4You hosted at <b><i>krake.one</i></b><br />
(via <a href="https://www.one.com/en/">one.com</a>. <b>REGRETS... Kind of</b>)</p>

<p>I got less and less interested in Krake, and I started fixing errors and messy<br />
code in my web pages. I dropped Krake4You, because it was too messy, but slowly I<br />
also dropped Krake.</p>

<p>This is about where I am now. I really learned a lot and I have a lot cleaner code, honestly.<br />
I got <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> to manage all my passwords,<br />
I learned to hash passwords in websites using BCrypt, still better than a few<br />
"professional" websites (unfortunately, because, good god why don't people do that ._.)<br />
The next thing coming here, happened this exact summer, I'm writing this.</p>

<p>The same friend who wanted to make Krake4You now wanted to make "Krake".... But a social media.<br />
I had my own ideas around about the same thing, so I started. He quickly because inactive again though,<br />
so I decided I was going to take the new Krake in my own hands.<br /><br />
It made it's way to BETA. It was a chat program with API and more. A little bit messy code,<br />
but MUCH better. If we compare the HTML from one page in Krake vs the HTML from one page of<br />
Twitter or YouTube and run them in <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a>,
Krake have no errors, when Twitter and YouTube et.c have<br />
tons!!</p>

<p>About in the middle of the summer I dropped the new Krake too. I had worked with that non-stop, and<br />
I had to take a break. Now, at the end of the summer, this exact day I'm writing this,<br />
I abandoned that Krake too, because<br />
WE ALREADY HAVE THOUSANDS OF CHAT APPLICATIONS WHO NEEDS ANOTHER OMG FACEPALM.<br />
But I still have the Krake domain and all my email adresses here, so I built this page today to<br />
fill up the space.</p>
