<h1>j2D - 2D Java Game Library</h1>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/LEGOlord208/legolord208.github.io/releases/download/any/j2D.jar" download>Download</a></h1>

<p><i>Make games without writing that gosh darn game loop!</i></p>

<p>j2D will allow you to create games with the tick and render functions ready to go.<br />
Capture keys, mouse events and more the best way possible while keeping it simple!<br />
You also have screens ready to go. Instead of using a stage system - Just create different screens!</p>

<h1>Documentation:</h1>
<p>How could we better explain this library than let you explore an example project!?</p>
