		Hello Buddy! Nice to meet you.<br />

		Did you know I have Asperger's? That is why I'm awkward sometimes.<br />
	</p>
	<p>Actually, was that too much information for you? You are probably looking for my <a href="software.html">software</a>.</p>

		Hello World. Nice to meet you. I'm an idiot.<br />
		My life sucks, and so does my choices throughout my life.<br />
		If you're really interested to know, then go over to <a href="history.html">History</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Sorry for bothering you. You're probably looking for my crappy <a href="software.html">software</a>.</p>
	<p>
		I hate writing index pages and describing myself. What should I say on them?<br />
		I have Asperger's syndrome. For me it gets rid of those useless social skills I never use and
		throw them in the <s>trash</s> Recycling Bin (don't wanna be one to let down the environment).<br />
		My subconscious is also afraid you're better than me. Fuck my subconsciousness. How does it matter who "is better"?<br />
		I hate myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you feel like I just threw a bunch of useless information at you at once, you're welcome.
		I mean, isn't it a good thing? Everyone acts like school is a good thing, and that's what they do... So...<br />
		If not, ask me anything you think I missed. <a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a>.
