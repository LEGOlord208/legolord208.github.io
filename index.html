			// People judge me for never writing comments, so here I'll write
			// a whole lot just to annoy everyone and as an easter egg.
			// 'location' is an object that represents the current location.
			// 'href' is an attribute that represents the URL.
			// Please note that that URL includes GET parameters
			// and the hash character plus all characters after it.
			// The spaces are not nessecary here and are just for
			// looking good, just like these extremely
			// useless comments.
			// I always forget the spelling of 'nessecary'.
			// The equal sign assign the variable on the left
			// to the value on the right.
			// "https://krake.one/" is a String object (basic text)
			// that represents 'https://krake.one/'.
			// JavaScript allows using ' as well as " I believe.
			// The ; character is called a 'semi-colon'. It is often used
			// in programming languages to terminate a command and moving on
			// to the next one. JavaScript also allows new lines to break commands,
			// so, it's unessecary.
			// I still don't know if I spelled unessecary correctly.
			// Probably not.
			// Anyway, the semi colon isn't needed and is only here because
			// I like to keep the same syntax across languages.
			location.href = "https://krake.one/";
