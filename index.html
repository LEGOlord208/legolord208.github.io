            <p>termplay allows you to display images and videos in your terminal!</p>
            <p>
                But it also supports a BUNCH of different "converters", so it should able to look good
                even in the most basic terminals.
                If you just want something simple, you can use normal ANSI sequences.
                If you really like quality, you can use sixels in a handful of terminals for really high quality.
                In other words you can make a really cool looking image still look really cool in your terminal!

            <p>
                Videos can be streamed directly from URIs (thanks, gstreamer).
                Videos can be zoomed and panned, revealing more details from the original frame.
                You can customize the frame rate, width, height, and more.
                Oh, and termplay is completely free and open source, of course.
